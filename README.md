Et voila - enyoy playing DnD on your server!

## Backstory

Back in 2020 during pandemic, my firends and I started playing DnD. One friend bought foundryvtt licence and I had a server doing nothing.
Now their documentation did not even mention systemd back then. So I had to write the file and do the setup myself.
